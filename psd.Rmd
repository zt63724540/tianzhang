## Crack Leetcode 
### PHASE 1: Three big topics
#### Array
#### String
#### Math



##### 1. Two Sum: hint: use dictionary
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

##### 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: use one pointer to indicate the index of unique elements
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/


##### 27. Remove Element: the key is the order of elements can be changed, so we can use two pointers which points to first and last respectively and do swap if find that value
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/


##### 35. Search Insert Position: binary search
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description/


##### 53. Maximum Subarray: if the cum sum below zero, then re-start the cum sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/

##### 66. Plus One: convert array of digits to a number and add one, then convert back
https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/description/

##### 88. Merge Sorted Array: the key of this question is the last of array 1 has available room to make use of, so start to fill in the end of array 1 by comparing the end of array 1 and array 2
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/

##### 118. Pascal's Triangle: first create a list of list with value 1 and then every element equals to two elements of the previous level
https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/description/

##### 119. Pascal's Triangle II: created a returned list with value 100.., use two loops to find the final solution. E.g. rowIndex = 5, then 10000->11000->12100->13310->14641
https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/description/

##### 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock: find the largest increment change
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/

##### 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II: cumulative all the increment change
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/

##### 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted: use two pointers, left and right
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/description/
